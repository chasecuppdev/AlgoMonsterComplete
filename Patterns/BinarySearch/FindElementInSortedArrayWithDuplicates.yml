TestCases:
  - Input: "[1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 10, 10, 10, 100], 3"
    Expected: "1"
    Notes: "Multiple duplicates - first occurrence in early position"
  
  - Input: "[1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 10, 10, 10, 100], 10"

    Notes: "Target appears twice consecutively"
  
  - Input: "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 4"
    Expected: "3"
    Notes: "Single occurrence of target - no duplicates"

    Expected: "0"
    Notes: "All elements are duplicates of target"
  
  - Input: "[1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 9], 5"
    Expected: "2"
    Notes: "Four consecutive duplicates in middle of array"
  
  - Input: "[-10, -5, -5, -1, 0, 3, 7], -5"

    Notes: "Negative numbers with duplicates"
  
  - Input: "[0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3], 0"
    Expected: "0"
    Notes: "Zero as target with duplicates at beginning"
